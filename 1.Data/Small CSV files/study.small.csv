Since we could get about 3,500 fosmid clones, we             determined the paired-end sequence of all fosmid clones. Next, we classified all clones             in phylum level based on the information for the origin of the genes identified in the             paired-end sequence and then we selected 179 clones evenly according to the ratio of             each classified phylum to cover whole microbial community. These selected clones were             sequenced by shotgun sequencing method (Sanger).

24,62641.0,PRJDB2168,DRP002224,A CTD code for RNA polymerase II promotes heterochromatin formation via lncRNA and RNAi,Other,"Some eukaryotic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin strucuture, but the molecular mechanism remais obscure. In fission yeast pericentromeric heterochromatin, the lncRNA transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) co-transcriptionally associates with heterochromatin and assembles the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery to produce siRNA, which promtes the methylation of histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9), a histone code for heterochromatin formation. The largest subunit of RNAPII has a carboxyl-terminal repeat domain (CTD) containing repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7, where differential phosphorylation of the residues (CTD codes) coordinates transcription and RNA processing. Here, we found that a phosphorylation of Ser7 directed co-transcriptional association of lncRNA with heterochromatin via the simultaneous binding of a RNA factor, Chp1 to methylated H3K9 and lncRNA. The Chp1-mediated association of lncRNA with chromatin is required for siRNA production and H3K9 methlation. These observations indicate a role for the CTD code in the regulation of histone code by lncRNAs.",,BioProject,A CTD code for RNA polymerase II promotes heterochromatin formation via lncRNA and RNAi,,,,,,,,,,,DRA002146,2015-12-24 21:27:58
